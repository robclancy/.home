This is just a repository to manage all my configuration between machines. It symlinks all the files from this repository into place with the `link-home.py` python script.

To use it yourself.
- fork and clone locally with the `--recursive` option
- update `.gitconfig` with your details
- run `python link-home.py`
- have some bacon to feel better about life in general
